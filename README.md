# FBScraper
A python script with functionality to scrape football/soccer data from FBRef.
Uses BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data and return it.

TODO:
- Update README file (Urgent) with how to use the script
- Research how to turn the script into an easily downloadable library
- Add functions to scrape more data
- Research the possibility of making some functions (such as returning a player link) static, so they are independant of an object which is usually tied to a specific league
